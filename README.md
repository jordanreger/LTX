### Contribute

Want to contribute? Awesome! There are many ways to contribute: 

#### Wiki
The wiki is an important tool for keeping people up-to-date on the latest information about everything space-related; Mars, Starship, the Rutherford engine, you name it! So how can you help? Well, if you know anything about space, it's simple — write! If you know the Markdown format already, you're ready to start writing! Take a look at the wiki template (coming soon) first, and then write to your heart's content. If you don't know Markdown, <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/">here's a cheat sheet</a>!

#### Launch Schedule
The launch schedule is easy to contribute to! All you need to know is when rockets are launching. Take a look at the launch schedule template (coming soon) first, then check and see if the launch you know about exists already. If not, make a new file following the template, and submit it! If your information is correct, it'll be submitted and on the site shortly!

#### Code
Contributing to the code takes a little bit more knowledge. If you know **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**/**TypeScript**, you're ready to start writing code! We use <a href="https://deno.land">Deno</a> for the backend and pure HTML/CSS for the frontend. <a href="">Make a pull request</a> when you're ready! Make sure it's verbose. If your pull request is for something unrelated, it may not be merged.

Finally, **thank you for contributing!**

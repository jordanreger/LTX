### Overview

Rocket Lab's Electron rocket is their workhorse rocket, built to take smaller satellites to orbit in a cost-effective manner. It is partially reusable as of now, with plans to catch the booster via parachute and a helicopter. 

| Height | Diameter | Payload to LEO |

### Engines
Electron has the Rutherford engine, the world's first 3d printed rocket engine with an electric fuel pump. The booster carries 9 sea level engines, and the second stage carries one vacuum-optimized Rutherford engine.

<br/>

### Reusability
Rocket Lab plans on making Electron a partially reusable vehicle by deploying a parachute and catching it with a helicopter.
